                     TL;DR: Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an OSDHack Member Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with an OSDHack representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.
                </div>

                <div>
                    We are committed to providing a welcoming, friendly, supportive, safe, and professional environment for all participants at our events, regardless of age, background, belief, disability, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, identity, national origin, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.
                </div>

                <div>
                    OSDHack stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
                </div>

                <div>
                    Harassment includes but is not limited to, offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
                </div>

                <div>
                    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, OSDHack staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
                </div>

                <div>
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, OSDHack may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.
                </div>

                <div>
                    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact OSDHack using the reporting procedures defined below. OSDHack representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

The form will be reviewed by the Director and Manager, and any action to address and/or resolve the issue will be communicated within one week.

                <div>
                    However, if you prefer to raise the unacceptable behavior to an independent party, you can contact one of the University of Bristol Acceptable Behavior Supporters who are volunteers trained to provide an informal advisory service to staff experiencing unacceptable behavior, bullying, or harassment at work. They can also support staff who are facing allegations about their behavior.
